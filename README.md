<h1> Local YouTube Downloader Plus! </h1>
Welcome to Local YouTube Downloader+! This is a fork of <a href="https://greasyfork.org/nb/scripts/369400-local-youtube-downloader">Local YouTube Downloader</a> with various improvements, like grammar. This is relatively new, expect more in the future!

<h2> Features </h2>
<b>Dark Mode</b>
Don't blind yourself at night! I added a dark mode to Local YouTube Downloader Plus. If your system/browser is in dark mode, then the window that pops up when you download a video will also be in dark mode. 

<b> Better Grammar </b>
The original script has some terrible grammar, so I fixed it. Not a big thing though

<b> More to come! </b>
